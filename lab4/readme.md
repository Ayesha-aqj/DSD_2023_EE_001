### Procedure

1- A test bench was created in `system verilog` for the circuit provided

2- RTL and test bench was compiled in **QUESTASIM** and then was simulated, the purpose of doing this was to find details of any *bug* in RTL or test bench and also to verify the truth table of the circuit.

3- RTL and test bench for an adder circuit was also corrected and was observed in questasim.
