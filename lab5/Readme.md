## LAB 5
### PROCEDURE:

1- Firstly truth table was made on the basis of given conditions.It has 16 combinatons of input due to` two 2-bit inputs a and b`

2- After that `K-maps` were made for each light i.e., `R,G and B` (According to the given conditions when a > b Purple light will glow i.e., R and G are at logic 1  etc)

3- RTL was written in `vivado` and schematic was made and also test bech for the RTL was simulated in `QuestSim`

4-Different points of interest was noted such as maximum combinational delays and utilized objets.
